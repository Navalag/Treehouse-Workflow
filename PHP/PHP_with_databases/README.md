## Integrating PHP with Databases

### About this Course/Project:

Building a PHP-driven page is the first step in mastering PHP. The true power of PHP shines when you connect it to a data source like an API or a Database.

Here we used [Basic PHP Website](https://github.com/Navalag/Treehouse-Workflow/tree/master/PHP/PHP_website) project and improved it with databases.

We've refactored this project by replacing an associative array with a database to provide a more robust and scalable tool to store the data in the media library.

In the process, we learned how to use PDO -- a PHP extension to communicate with a database. Also learned about relational databases including how to search for data across multiple tables, as well as how to add common web site features like search forms and pagination.
