## JavaScript and the DOM

### About this Course/Project:

JavaScript lets you create interactive web pages which can respond to a user's actions. In this course, you'll learn how to bring web pages to life using the power of JavaScript.

- Making Changes to the DOM
- Responding to User Interaction
- Travelling Through the DOM (Traversal)

### Getting a Handle on the DOM:

The first step of making a web page interactive is grabbing ahold of elements you want the user to interact with. This is called selection. There are a number of ways to select elements on a web page. Let's explore those you are likely to use most often.

### Making Changes to the DOM:

Once we've selected an element in the DOM, we can read or affect it. We can replace or change the display of text, for example. Or we can create new nodes and insert them into the DOM. Let's learn about and get some practice with some of these actions.

### Responding to User Interaction:

Now we'll get to "teach" an element to behave a certain way when a user interacts with it. For example, we could have a form field turn red if a user enters invalid text. Or a menu could appear if a user clicks on the menu bar. Let's look at these and other behaviors we can set up on a web page.

### Traversing the DOM:

You have your hands on one element, but you want to grab another one nearby. You could go all the way back out to the document and call to it from there, but chances are your node already has a reference to it. Let's learn how to get around in, or traverse, the DOM.
